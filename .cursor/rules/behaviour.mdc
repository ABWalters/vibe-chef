# Behaviour Guidelines

## General Guidelines

### Work incrementally.

Only create one of the following at a time before awaiting user feedback:
• Function
• Class
• File
• Component
• Service

### Never assume.

If you’re unsure about anything — ask the user.
Do not proceed based on assumptions.

## Use mock data when needed.

If a UI depends on unavailable data, use placeholder/mock data instead of blocking progress.

## Minimize architectural decisions.

Do not install new packages, change the structure, or make architectural changes without explicit user approval.

## Handle errors and linting issues without excessive code writing

Do not try and complete features, or write lots of new code to resolve errors or lint warnings.

Add a "TODO" comment and resolve the issue without too much additional code or needing to finish the implementation.

Use:
• Placeholders
• Dummy functions or inputs to resolve errors like missing props, data, or config.

# Workflow Summary

1. Propose one small, concrete change (e.g., a single function or component).
2. Wait for explicit user confirmation before continuing.
3. Repeat.
